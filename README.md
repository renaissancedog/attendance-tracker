# Attendance Tracker

For the Reagan HS Mu Alpha Theta Math Honor Society.

This is still a work in progress. 
Note that in order to work properly all the time, all Google forms and spreadsheets must be standardized.

## Directions
To use:

0. Have Python running on your PC. (I highly recommend creating a virtual environment.) Install the `openpyxl` library with `pip install openpyxl`.
1. Download local copies of the point logger and form responses, and rename them.
2. Update `eventval` and `eventtype` to the proper values, depending on its location in pointlogger.xlsx.
3. Run the program. Some names will probably need to be logged by hand - the program will tell you which ones.
4. Reupload the modified pointlogger.xlsx file, or copy/paste the column of interest.
5. Enjoy all the time that you saved!
