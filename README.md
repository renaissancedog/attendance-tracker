# Attendance Tracker

For the Reagan HS Mu Alpha Theta Math Honor Society.

This is still a work in progress. 
Note that in order to work properly all the time, all Google forms and spreadsheets must be standardized.

## Directions
To use:
1. Download local copies of the point logger and form responses, and rename them.
2. Update `eventval` and `eventtype` to the proper values, depending on its location in pointlogger.xlsx.
3. Run the program. Some names will probably need to be logged by hand.
4. Reupload the modified pointlogger.xlsx file.
5. Enjoy your free time!

Contributions are welcomed!
